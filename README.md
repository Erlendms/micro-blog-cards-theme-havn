## Installation
- Open the Design page in your Micro.blog settings.
- Set your current theme to Blank and Hugo Version to 0.91 in the design section of your blog admin.
- Uninstall any theme that you already have installed.
- Install the Cards theme.

## Customizations
You can customize the colors in the Cards theme from your Plugin Settings screen.

The name of each setting should be self-explanatory. The Body colors affect the content outside the “cards,” and the Card colors affect the “cards” themselves.

> The colors may be overwritten when a new update to the theme is published. This is a known bug in Micro.blog that will hopefully be fixed soon. To avoid this, you can copy the content in the config.json file, update the theme, then paste the values back into the config.json file.

- Click on Design, then Custom Themes.
- Click on the config.json file in the Templates for Cards section.
- Copy the content, then go back.
- Update the Cards theme.
- Click on Design, then Custom Themes.
- Click on the config.json file in the Templates for Cards section.
- Paste the contents you copied earlier.
- Click on the Update Template button to save your changes.

## How to add additional customizations
The easiest (and safest) way to customize this theme is to create a new blank theme while the Cards theme is installed. You can customize the template files in your blank theme without changing this Cards theme.

When updates are pushed out to the Cards theme, the theme files will be updated automatically. Any custom theme files you have in your custom theme will be untouched.
